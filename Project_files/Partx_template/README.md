# Geographical Plotting with Python Part 1 -
## Your first Geo Chart
After we succeeded in installing the **basemap** package, we will follow the tutorial given by Sentdex-YouTube Channel. The purpose is to draw and use both the longitudinal and latitudinal-coordinates.
In this series, you are taught how to plot on a map with python and do geographical plotting with the matplotlib extension called basemap. Now that you are pretty much a pro at all other things Matplotlib, it is time to learn how to spread your wings a bit and begin working with geo-plotting on maps, using basemap. Basemap works alongside Matplotlib to allow you to plot via latitude and longitude coordinates. Once you have basemap installed, you can use the following code to quickly show a simple map. This will just render and display a map, but soon we'll be plotting, zooming, and more fun things!

## Step -1-
Information are located in the matplotlib --> basemap, we will use the projection.
Error Corrected: it seems that we need to stop the formating on save feature and linting for the editior as the packages sequence (priority) is important. Form Mac
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
```
